# flask-reddit
A basic implementation of Reddit using Flask.

NOTE: The website currently uses a self-signed certificate, i.e. one not generated by a trusted CA authority, that causes a warning message to appear. Bypassing this warning message allows you to navigate to the application. I'm currently working to replace this with a CA-provided certificate.
